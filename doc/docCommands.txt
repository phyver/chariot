Toplevel and Commands
---------------------

Each command to the toplevel needs to end with a ";" or a blank line.

The top level interprets type definitions (:help types) and recursive
definitions (:help def) and adds them to the context.

A single term given after the prompt is evaluated and the result is printed.

Structures are evaluated lazily and the system prints a "hole" with a number
for each subterm whose evaluation is frozen:

    # arith 0 1;
    >> term: arith 0 1
    >> of type: stream(nat)
    >> result: {
    >>   Head = <1> ;
    >>   Tail = <2> }

<1> and <2> are examples of such holes.


To reduce them, we give the command

    # > 1,2

If no hole is given, the system with evaluate all the holes...



The other commands are
    :help                   to display this help
    :help types             to display help about type definitions
    :help def               to display help about value definitions
    :help commands          to display this message
    :help syntax            to display help about chariot's syntax

    :set                    to list the available options with there current value
    :set <option> <value>   to change the value of an optiond

    :show <name>            to show a function definition or a type definition
    :show env               to show the whole environment
    :show types             to show all the type definitions
    :show functions         to show all the recursive definitions

    :type <term>            to infer the type of a term and show the types of all its components
    :reduce <term>          to reduce a term and show the result
    :unfold <term>, <depth> to reduce a term and unfold all its frozen components, up to a given depth
    :echo <string>          to echo some statis message
    :quit                   to quit!
