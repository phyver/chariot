-- The problem is that prod(...) has priority 4 and stream(nat) has priority 2
-- In the following, the greatest move appearing infinitely often is Tail, with priority 2.
-- The test should give TRUE
-- However, the move Snd, that comes and goes (=> weight 0) has priority 4, and
-- while adding them, I only keep <0>4 and the test concludes FALSE
